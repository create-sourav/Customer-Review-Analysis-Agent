Customer Review Analysis AI Agent
This project implements an AI-powered agent to efficiently analyze customer reviews. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), the system extracts structured insights from unstructured customer feedback. The goal is to help businesses understand customer satisfaction, identify key trends, and improve products or services by summarizing reviews and performing sentiment analysis.

Features:
•	Takes raw customer reviews as input: The agent is designed to work with a list of customer feedback text.
•	Uses LLM chain to analyze and summarize reviews: Employs an LLM framework like LangChain to process the text.
•	Extracts key positives and sentiments in structured JSON format: The output is easy to parse and use for further analysis.
•	Processes single or multiple reviews efficiently: The system is scalable and can handle multiple reviews in a single run.
•	Outputs results in a human-readable, formatted JSON style: This makes the results easy for humans to read and for machines to process.
•	Easily extendable for further NLP tasks or business analytics: The modular design allows for adding more advanced features.


Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/create-sourav/customer-review-analysis.git
cd customer-review-analysis



Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set up environment variables for API keys:
You need to set up your API key for the LLM provider you are using (e.g., OpenAI, Google Generative AI).

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"


Note: Replace OPENAI_API_KEY with the appropriate variable for your chosen LLM.

Run the notebook or script:
You can run the Jupyter notebook Customer_Review_Analysis_Agent_.ipynb or a Python script if one is available.

Usage
Load your list of customer reviews into a variable, for example, reviews.

Call the AI agent (LLM chain) to analyze each review.

Obtain structured JSON outputs with summaries and key points.

Use the output for reporting, dashboards, or further data analysis.

How It Works
The project uses a framework like LangChain to build an LLM chain. This chain takes each review as input, processes it, and generates a structured output containing a summary, a list of positive points, and sentiment information. The final output is then converted to JSON for easy integration.
